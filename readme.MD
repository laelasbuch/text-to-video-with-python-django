# Text To Video and Audio
5-minute video with audio from text in Python using the Django framework, HTML, and CSS involves multiple steps, and it's a complex task. Here's a simplified example of how you can achieve this using a combination of libraries and tools:

## Setup Django Project
First, make sure you have Django installed. Create a new Django project and app.

``` bash
django-admin startproject video_creator
cd video_creator
python manage.py startapp video_generator
```

## Install Required Packages
You will need some external packages to generate video and audio. You can use the MoviePy library for video creation and gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for text-to-speech conversion.

``` bash
pip install django moviepy gTTS
```
## Run Migrations
Apply the database migrations to create the VideoText model's table.

``` bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
## Run the Development Server
Start the Django development server.

``` bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Now, when you visit http://localhost:8000/generate/ in your browser, you should see a form where you can input text, and upon submission, it will generate a 5-minute video with the provided text and display it on the page.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and in a real-world application, you would need error handling, user authentication, and more advanced features. Additionally, you may want to explore more options for styling the HTML and CSS to enhance the user interface.
